       <p><strong> various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.</strong><hr> The traditional goals of AI 
        research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for 
        robotics.[a] General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the 
        field's long-term goals.<br>[4] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including 
        search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[5] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when
        deep learning outperformed previous Al techniques.[11]<em> This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer 
        architecture,[12] and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the "AI boom"). </em>
        <del>The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns
            about its risks and long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and
            benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems.</del>
        These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display.
        <h1>The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.</h1>
        [awhen they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late <mark>1980s and 1990s</mark>, methods were developed for dealing with
        uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14] Many of these algorithms are
        insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become
        exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] <small>Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research
            could model.</small> They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is
        an unsolved problem.
